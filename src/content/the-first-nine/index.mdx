      title: "There's a sharp pain when I think about sharing",
      subtitle: "The body knows what the mind denies",
      content: `Hot metal slashes across my stomach when I consider being seen. The internet feels like a church basement where questions meant rejection, where David with his glasses tallied our scripture failures, where shame became the only prayer I knew.

<div className="poem">My head is filled with church bells
Signaling a joyous day. 
The ringing sings out across
My inner landscape
And reverberates in pockets of my remembering flesh. 
I do and have done such disservice. 
I am a walking vibration of abuses. 
They line up at my door seeking their due,
Saying, Joy sent me here.</div>

The body remembers: throat clenched, jaw locked, neck turning away. Each muscle holds a story of the times I couldn't ask, couldn't speak, couldn't risk being cast out. Now when I think of sharing, my flesh puckers like fruit left too long in the sun.

But here's the medicine: What I'm most reluctant to share carries healing proportional to my resistance. The body knows before the mind admits. These sensations aren't warnings—they're invitations wearing fear's familiar costume.`

      title: "I build elaborate systems to avoid simple feelings",
      subtitle: "The architecture of avoidance",
      content: `I've become an architect of beautiful prisons, each framework more elegant than the last. My constraints offer a type of hug—pressure that feels safe but carries winter's touch. I search for the perfect structure like a moth seeking the moon, believing if I could only find it, then relief.

<div className="poem">Symbols latch my eye
with hyper color hooks.
Brands sing siren songs
of promised meaning.

I'm pushing myself again
to rest the restless beam
of my attention
on the unique desire of my Soul.</div>

The decorator arrives too early, wanting to beautify the mess before it's had time to mean anything. He polishes surfaces while depths remain untouched. Trust the desire paths, trust the creative mess, trust that the garden grows in darkness too.

<div className="poem">Could it be that I crave 
the very things 
that keep me small?

It's so nice to be held back
from the electric possibility 
of becoming all of me.</div>

The truth: This garden isn't about artifacts but about cultivating soil where inner dialogue transforms. Structure and emergence must dance, not battle. The map was never the territory.`

      title: "I can't stop lashing myself forward",
      subtitle: "Little whips and familiar poisons",
      content: `<div className="poem">little lashes
motivating myself by not liking myself
little lashes across the back

they hurt 
and i resent them
and i love their pain
because it
takes me
where i think i want to go</div>

The critic speaks with sugar-coated venom, sweet in intention but corrosive in method. There's nothing it says that's fully true—just partial truths weaponized against wholeness. You wouldn't keep a boss who managed like this voice manages you.

Tools become weapons when wielded for improvement. The moment I use them to "get better," they lose their magic. Love drains out, leaving only the hollow ring of should.

<div className="poem">the young woman
slams shut her laptop
through desperate smiling frustration 
"why don't i let myself stop working?!"

her friend responds,
"you love its purpose."</div>

The revelation: Enjoyment leaves you with more energy than you began with. Each experiment asks only one question: How can I enjoy this 10% more? 

The work is its own reward. Just add connection.`

      title: "Joy feels like a heart attack",
      subtitle: "When expansion threatens identity",
      content: `Big heartfelt joy arrives like a tidal wave threatening sandcastles I've spent decades building. The feelings expand beyond what the idea of self can contain. I become a speck of dust in an ocean of joy—unmoored, undefined, undone.

Fear of excitement means I'm already excited. The heart attack I imagine is actually my heart breaking open.

<div className="poem">Two possums
havin' a disagreement 
under the deck. 

Shouted across the house 
to my wife, "Possum battle!"
She said, "I can't come see,
I'm bottomless!"

The night is warm and windy,
joy spills over the cup of my heart.</div>

We know ourselves by contrast. In joy, the boundaries dissolve. Who am I in this? What remains when the walls come down?

<div className="poem">Has anything
you've ever loved
been so simply beige?

The other side
shines with the joy 
of misery welcomed 
earnestly home.

Your Soul invites friendship
with even that part of you.</div>

The glimmers grow: colorful joy appearing when the try-hard relaxes, pleasure arriving unabashed. Without fear, there's enough. It floods in when I'm vulnerable with my excitement.`

      title: "My body rebels when I ignore myself",
      subtitle: "GERD, raccoons, and midnight messages",
      content: `The raccoon peers through the sliding door at 3 AM—my wild self watching my domesticated self ignore all the signals. My body sends increasingly urgent messages: GERD burns when I swallow my words, exhaustion weighs when I carry what isn't mine, the stomach churns with undigested experiences.

<div className="poem">The body groans. 
Relax relax relax. 
What if it were easy?
What if you got to be a part of a team?</div>

Disconnection tastes like late-night scrolling, like making projects to be seen rather than to see. Connection tastes like saying yes to relationship, like sharing experiments just to watch what grows.

The medicine is always movement. Thirteen miles on the bike to let anger dissipate through my legs. Or simpler: blanket on earth, letting the ground hold what I cannot. The young parts need space more than solutions.

My body knows before my mind admits. Each symptom is a teacher speaking in sensation's mother tongue.`

      title: "I've been frozen in self-reliance",
      subtitle: "The glacier and the thaw",
      content: `The glacier took decades to form: Dad absent, Mom overwhelmed. "I'll figure it out myself" became my frozen mantra. Each layer of ice a protection against the helplessness of needing.

Then the Lexus breaks down in Dripping Springs. $435 for a tow. The whole elaborate system—buying reliable trucks, maintaining them obsessively, avoiding the need for help—collapses with an alternator's death.

The tow truck driver builds supercharged Harleys. Has a network he calls without thinking. "People helping people," he says, like it's the most natural thing. His ease illuminates my disease.

There's a part that loves the crisis, gets high on the anguish, feels alive tasting how unsafe the world can be. At least in breakdown, the ice cracks.

The paradox: My pattern of over-designing without inviting people in was meant to ensure independence. But reliance is freedom. Helplessness—that close cousin of surrender—is the most potent change agent for self-reliance.

We're healed in relationship. The glacier melts drop by drop, each request for help a small spring arriving.`

      title: "I feel like I don't belong anywhere",
      subtitle: "The nomad's longing",
      content: `Between contexts, I speak many languages but feel native to none. Aesthetics in one camp, emotional fitness in another, technical fluency in a third. Digitally culturally spiritually homeless, carrying my ache like a passport to nowhere.

This loneliness—I've made it special, a designer pain no one else could possibly own. But giving up the special means joining humanity. The knot in my gut loosens when I whisper: "Just like everyone else, I feel this."

I've touched the bottom of aloneness and found, surprisingly, joy stirring in the depths. The belief that I'm a mistake plays across reality only because I insist on the performance.

<div className="poem">Patience is the slow unraveling
of an urgent tangle,
careful hands 
enjoying knots
unrushed.
Invited to speak
the natural pace
of our voice,
nowhere else to be
in the living room
of Soul.</div>

There's a home in artists' hearts—my siblings, my champions, my kin. The love of it is almost too much to feel. But here's the secret: I've been home all along. This garden is my practice of belonging to myself.`

      title: "I abandon things right before they bloom",
      subtitle: "The threshold dance",
      content: `I wait until pain becomes unbearable before clarifying what I want. Then I move toward it slowly, numbing again, until discomfort forces another burst of clarity. It's exhausting, this threshold dance—approaching breakthrough then retreating to safety.

There's strange satisfaction in staying insignificant. It protects me from engaging with what I'm here to channel.

<div className="poem">Something is shifting 
<div class="poem">Something is shifting 
The gates are moving
The keepers are rejiggering their positions

I am afraid of combining project based learning, the garden, and the portfolio 

Who has the sense of what's coming?
How can I not know?
How can I be in the service of the sense?

A part of me wishes to hands-on create
To be the name on the building
Another deeper sense wishes to serve 
An emerging energy 
Open up 
Speak to those who hear the call
It lives in relationship</div>

The skipping-ahead pattern: Learn to coach before coaching, lead before being led. Always jumping stages to avoid the vulnerability of being a beginner.

But projects aren't containers for achievement—they're vessels for evolution. Have a light hand. Risk their loss. What matters will survive the harvest.

It takes as long as it takes.`

                title: "Anger feels like drowning",
                subtitle: "The dam and the flow",
                content: `Behind the dam: decades of swallowed fire. I needed loving attention and got shame and grief and scolding. Now anger feels like drowning because I've forgotten how to swim in my own truth.

The symptoms of repression: extreme self-talk, isolation that can't be soothed, feeling uncontainable, taking up too much space. My body speaks what my voice won't.

Then Kristen offers: "I see your anger and don't judge you." 

Something fundamental shifts. I rant in text, move like a maniac, scream into pillows. Not dramatic. Just necessary. Immediate clarity after.

<div class="poem">The ocean as loving awareness. 
Everything made of the same stuff. 
Infinite abundance. 
Don't need to hold onto any particular aspect of any of it, 
there's so much.</div>

Emotions are weather systems, not binding contracts. On anger's backside: clarity. Behind helplessness: empowerment. After sadness: relief.

The truth that changes everything: If you're scared of feeling an emotion, you're already in it.`
