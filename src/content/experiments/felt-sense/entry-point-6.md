# I've been frozen in self-reliance

_The glacier and the thaw_

[← Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## The Frozen State

"The glacier of self-reliance is thawing, but old patterns keep trying to freeze it back up." (Week 8)

"I don't trust anyone. I'll figure it out myself." (Week 2)

## Ancestral Ice

"The shame around asking for help is ancestral—mom frazzled, dad absent." (Week 8)

"Not knowing is shameful... Having the answer makes you good. Not having the answer makes you bad." (Week 2)

## The Breakdown that Breaks Through

"I decided to drive the Lexus (despite subconscious misgivings) and the alternator seems to have gone out. This is drumming up all sorts of emotions. A strong reliance trigger is at the root of it." (Week 8)

"There's a part of me that loves the problem, gets excited by the anguish of all this, that feels alive in the excitement of the possibility of breaking down somewhere." (Week 8)

## Simple Wisdom from the Tow Truck

"'People helping people' is nothing to the tow truck driver. His natural interdependence highlights my cultivated isolation." (Week 8)

"The collaborative world isn't actually expanding - my willingness to perceive and engage with it is." (Week 8)

## Revelation - The Paradox

"My pattern is to over design without inviting people in. To avoid reliance. Reliance is freedom." (Multiple weeks)

"Leaning into helplessness is one of the most potent change agents for self-reliance." (Week 5)

"We're healed in relationship. To be loved for the thing we're ashamed of." (Week 1 & 8)
