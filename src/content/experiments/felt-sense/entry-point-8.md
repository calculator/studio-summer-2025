# I abandon things right before they bloom

_The threshold dance_

[‚Üê Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## The Pattern

"The threshold dance - retreating just before breakthrough - keeps me safe but stuck. I abandon what I most desire at the moment of its arrival." (Week 7)

"I'm recognizing a pattern where I wait until things are extremely painful until I clarify and move toward what I want." (Week 4)

## Something is Shifting

```
Something is shifting
The gates are moving
The keepers are rejiggering their positions

I am afraid of combining project based learning, the garden, and the portfolio

The patterns of play are open source
Who has the sense of what's coming?
How can I not know?
How can I be in the service of the sense?
This creates a wiggle within. A turning of my stomach
A part of me wishes to hands-on create
To discover new pattern
To be the name on the building
Another deeper sense wishes to serve
An emerging energy
A communal possibility
A relational, collaborative way of supporting through the projects which define us
Open up
Speak to those who hear the call
It's here, waiting to meet you
It lives in relationship

A vision of reaching out
A vision of interviewing
A vision of being a man in conversation
Using the garden to report on what I'm finding
To aide in the communication of essay

A part of me wishes to throw out this notion
This friction. This sense of a right way to do it
This idea of what an essay is
Of how communication should work
Of what is trying to be accomplished
The fear of setting out with a goal
Of not living up
```

## The Fear of Arrival

"The thing that we're avoiding is usually the most direct path to our freedom." (Week 6)

"The tendency to jump ahead into a should vision... this a pleasurable way to not do the small work close to hand." (Week 3)

## Revelation

"Projects are an iterative container for evolution. Not for the purpose of being done." (Week 6)

"Have a light hand with your experiments. Risk their loss. What's important will make it through to harvest." (Week 2)

"It takes as long as it takes." (Week 6)
