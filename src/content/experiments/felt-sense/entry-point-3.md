# I can't stop lashing myself forward

_Little whips and familiar poisons_

[‚Üê Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## Little Lashes

```
little lashes
are motivating myself by not liking myself
little lashes across the back
keep going
get up
find a reason

they hurt
and i resent them
and i love their pain
because it
takes me
where i think i want to go

the young woman
in the cafe
slams shut her laptop
through a desperate smiling frustration
looks to her friend says,
"why don't i let myself stop working?!"

the friend, framed in blonde waves
and giving a field of
Tell me, my love
responds,
"you love its purpose."
```

## The Critical Voice Pattern

"There's nothing the critical voice in the says to you that's true. Until you see that fact, you're fucked." (Week 7)

"The critic acts as incompetent protector - quite sweet in intention but utterly destructive in method." (Week 7)

## When Tools Become Weapons

"The tools work until I use them to improve myself. As soon as you do them to get better they will have no effect." (Week 6)

"If you're running experiments to manage yourself, they stop working." (Week 2)

"Get the should out of the experiment." (Week 2)

## The Shame Cycle

"Shame yourself for drinking, best way to keep drinking. Shame a kid for being naughty is the best way to make sure they're naughty in the future." (Week 5)

## Revelation - A Different Fuel

"Release myself from 'little lashes' of self-criticism. Motivation through self-dislike is a familiar poison I'm learning to transform into a virtue through acceptance." (Week 4)

"Enjoyment in the doing is efficient. It leaves you with more energy than you went in with." (Week 4 & 7)

"I am openhearted, I am in love with all of me. You are welcome, you are loved, just as you are." (Week 2)
