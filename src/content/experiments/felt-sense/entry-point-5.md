# My body rebels when I ignore myself

_GERD, raccoons, and midnight messages_

[‚Üê Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## The Body's Protests

"I eat too much when disconnected. My body uses GERD as a messenger when my mind won't listen. The raccoon at night is watching me ignore myself." (Week 7)

"Woke with a smattering of somatic discomfort. Feeling ill. Spent time surfing the emotions. A lot of constriction." (Week 4)

## The Body Groans

```
The body groans.
Relax relax relax.
What if it were easy,
what if the abundance of love and connection
was just how it is?
What if you didn't have to work to earn it?
What if you got to be a part of a team?
```

## Disconnection Patterns

"Disconnection to self feels like isolating. hanging out with the phone. trying to make projects to be seen." (Week 4)

"Connection to self feels like saying yes to relationship. spending time together." (Week 4)

## Movement as Medicine

"The body is opened up again after exercise. Had been bottled up. If I do a ride like that 3x a week this energy will have a chance to move and it will level out." (Week 4)

"When I laid on the earth instead of pushing through frustration, young parts found the space they needed." (Week 8)

## Revelation

"My body knows before my mind does." (Week 7)

"Feeling the intensity of these feelings, not rushing them off or pushing through them. Meeting them with curiosity. They appear to relax and energy begins to flow again." (Week 4)
