# Anger feels like drowning

_The dam and the flow_

[‚Üê Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## The Dam

"The shame around anger is a dam holding back the movement toward moving emotion this way." (Week 8)

"I am fucking pissed about the abuse when I was younger. What I did to myself, what was done to me. I needed loving attention and I got shame and grief and scolding." (Week 4)

## When It Moves

"When Kristen offered 'I see your anger and don't judge you,' something fundamental shifted." (Week 8)

"Moving emotion through my body - ranting, shaking, yelling into pillows - creates immediate clarity." (Week 8)

## The Ocean Teaching

```
The ocean as loving awareness.
Everything made of the same stuff.
Infinite abundance.
Don't need to hold onto any particular aspect of any of it,
there's so much.
```

## Revelation

"Emotions seem to be the core of the work." (Week 4)

"Stop treating emotions like binding contracts. They're weather systems moving through, neither permanent nor personal." (Week 7)

"If you're scared of feeling an emotion you're already in it." (Week 6)
