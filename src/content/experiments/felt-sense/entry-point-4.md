# Joy feels like a heart attack

_When expansion threatens identity_

[‚Üê Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## The Terror of Good Feelings

"Big heartfelt open joy is harder to feel. It feels less safe. 'Oh my god this can be taken away from me'. 'Oh my god what's happening, who am I in this?'" (Week 7)

"When I'm excited about something, I experience anxiety because joy can feel 'unmooring' - it dissolves the contrasts by which I know myself." (Week 7)

## Two Possums (Joy Breaking Through)

```
Two possums
havin' a disagreement
under the deck.

Sounded like they were
in the living room with me.
I opened the front door
and banged my knee on the doorframe
involuntary jump.

Shouted across the house
to my wife, "Possum battle!"
She said, "I can't come see,
I'm bottomless!"

The night is warm and windy,
joy spills over the cup of my heart.
```

## The Body's Confusion

"Fear of excitement means I'm already excited. Heart attack anxiety means my heart is already breaking open." (Week 7)

"The feelings are so big, so expansive, the idea of self can't compete." (Week 7)

## Why Would It Be

```
Why would it be
that your Soul's desire
is a righteous good?

Has anything
you've ever loved
been so simply beige?

The other side
shines with the joy
of misery welcomed
earnestly home.

So, kiss the brow
of your small one,
loving their dark creativity.

Your Soul invites friendship
with even that part of you.
```

## When Joy Arrives

"I felt the try-hard relax and a colorful joy appeared. A sense of unabashed pleasure." (Week 6)

"Without the fear: there's enough. It shows up when I open to connection. It floods in when I'm vulnerable with my excitement." (Week 6)

## Revelation

"It's so nice to be held back from the electric possibility of becoming all of me." (Week 1)

"Beginning to feel the joy of not needing to be liked. Small glimmers." (Week 7)
