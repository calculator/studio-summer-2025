# The Thawing - Felt-Sense Entry Points & Material

A living exploration of the body's wisdom and the patterns that keep us small. Each entry point is a doorway into different aspects of the same healing journey.

## Entry Points

1. **[There's a sharp pain when I think about sharing](/experiments/felt-sense/entry-point-1)**  
   _The body knows what the mind denies_

2. **[I build elaborate systems to avoid simple feelings](/experiments/felt-sense/entry-point-2)**  
   _The architecture of avoidance_

3. **[I can't stop lashing myself forward](/experiments/felt-sense/entry-point-3)**  
   _Little whips and familiar poisons_

4. **[Joy feels like a heart attack](/experiments/felt-sense/entry-point-4)**  
   _When expansion threatens identity_

5. **[My body rebels when I ignore myself](/experiments/felt-sense/entry-point-5)**  
   _GERD, raccoons, and midnight messages_

6. **[I've been frozen in self-reliance](/experiments/felt-sense/entry-point-6)**  
   _The glacier and the thaw_

7. **[I feel like I don't belong anywhere](/experiments/felt-sense/entry-point-7)**

## Universal Fragments

**The Garden**

- "As within, so without."
- "My garden is a practice of loving myself."
- "The garden grows whether you're watching or not."

**Fear as Gateway**

- "Feel the fear and the rest happens."
- "Finding the fears in your life is like finding the doorways to get out of the stuck patterns you're in."
- "The sense of self dies in the undefended process."

**The Truth About Parts**

- "I love creatives. The messy, the emotional, the brilliant, the ordinary, the gifted, the weird, the driven, the sad and mopey, the can't get started and can't get out of bed, the too much and need to be seen."
- "How you meet them is how you meet yourself."

**Spring Update**

```
Spring update
The bees were in the purple trees in the front yard last week.
Pollinating away.
This week The bees seem to have moved on and the trees are exploding with green.
```

**Final Wisdom**

- "Your most profound strength is the ability to feel discomfort all the way through."
- "When I honor what I truly care about—even when it feels small or insignificant—I discover a path to both freedom and form."
