# I feel like I don't belong anywhere

_The nomad's longing_

[‚Üê Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## Between Worlds

"A part that feels out of context. Between many contexts. The value of aesthetics in one camp, the value of emotional fitness in another, the technical acumen of a third. Many languages, nomadic. The longing for belonging." (Week 3)

"I have been digitally culturally spiritually homeless. This is my home." (Week 1)

## The Special Separation

"This is my loneliness. No one else has a loneliness this special." (Week 4)

"The distance from a tangible local need. Silence and solitude foreground the feeling. An ache near my heart which tells me I don't have a place." (Week 3)

## The Bottom

"I have touched such horrendous loneliness and still I'm here. There is a joy stirring." (Week 3)

"The belief that I am a mistake, that there's no place for me plays itself across reality because I must have it so." (Week 3)

## Patience

```
Patience is the slow unraveling
of an urgent tangle,
careful hands
enjoying knots
unrushed.
Invited to speak
the natural pace
of our voice,
nowhere else to be
in the living room
of Soul.
```

## Revelation

"You already belong. The belief that you're a mistake plays itself across reality because you insist on it." (Week 3)

"The special loneliness I've protected isn't special at all. It's the common human experience I've been using to keep myself separate." (Week 5)

"The threshold of belonging offers an opportunity to become intimate with the intensities of love." (Week 3)
