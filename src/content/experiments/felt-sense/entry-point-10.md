# Words feel closed, not open

_When language becomes a cage_

[← Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## The Constriction

"When the words are open rather than closed, love flows through them more readily. The language of the world becomes connective." (Week 8)

"When released from the belief that I have an obligation to be understood there is a lot more spaciousness." (Week 2)

## The Writer's Pain

"The sharp pain of loving the writing. I have missed the dance of words. I miss connecting through. I fear the sharp pain of my critical voices." (Week 4)

"On the notion of plagiary, I got it in my head from school that if I weren't entirely original that I was stealing or wrong This is an impossible mind and is a type of torture." (Week 7)

## Technical Overflow

"Your 'technical overflow' isn't about ideas—it's connection seeking. Try 'i'm feeling scattered and want you to see me' instead." (Week 2)

## The Garden Teaching

```
The garden a living shrine
in devotional friendship with the Ally
who is a teacher
```

## Revelation

"In the space healing affords, new definitions of words arise." (Week 8)

"True expression requires neither total exposure nor complete protection, but rather a rhythmic pulse between intimacy and boundary." (Week 1)

"Originality was never the point. The lineage of ideas flows through me, not from me." (Week 7)
