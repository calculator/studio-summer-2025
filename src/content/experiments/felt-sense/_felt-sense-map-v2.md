## Entry Point 1: "There's a sharp pain when I think about sharing"
*The body knows what the mind denies*

### Fragments:

**Opening - The Physical Reality**

- "Hot metal slashes across my stomach. Proximity to a friend lying to themselves." (Week 1 Poem)

**Full Poem - The Cut**
```
Hot metal slashes
across my stomach.
Proximity to a friend
lying to themselves.

Cut

I want it to be
any other way. 

Cut

Invited to hard conversation.
To feel the disappointment.
To feel the small one abandoned. 
To realize I asked for this.

Then

A welcome. 
Join me in the garden,
let's feel this together.
It's a delight to embrace you.

—
There is a charge
```

**The Body's Memory**
- "Keep feeling the shame and resistance to publishing. There is a deep bind related to being seen. Needing loving witness, fearing being judged." (Week 5 & 6)
- "Trust the mess. Your fear of being judged for messiness is just the echo of that church basement where questions meant rejection." (Week 8)

**Full Poem - Church Bells**
```
My head is filled with church bells
Signaling a joyous day. 
The ringing sings out across
My inner landscape
And reverberates in pockets of my remembering flesh. 
I do and have done such disservice. 
I am a walking vibration of abuses. 
They line up at my door seeking their due,
Saying, Joy sent me here.
```

**Revelation - The Medicine in the Wound**
- "Shame is the outline of my identity. What I'm most reluctant to share is proportional to its healing potential." (Week 8)

---

## Entry Point 2: "I build elaborate systems to avoid simple feelings"
*The architecture of avoidance*

**The Pattern Recognition**

**Full Poem - Symbols and Seeking**
```
Symbols latch my eye
with hyper color hooks.
Brands sing siren songs
of promised meaning.

I'm pushing myself again
to rest the restless beam
of my attention
on the unique desire of my Soul.

Believing the I who is pushing
can fulfill this desire
without first having listened.
```

**The Decorator's Wisdom**
- "The decorator is a part who likes to beautify. Inviting him in too early is a cause of frustration." (Week 2)
- "My pattern is to over design without inviting people in. To avoid reliance. Reliance is freedom." (Week 6, 7, 8)

**What Lives Beneath**
- "Your obsession with containers keeps you from experiencing what they're meant to contain. The map isn't the territory, and your organizational systems aren't the creative life they're meant to serve." (Week 1 Clearing)

**Full Poem - The Numbing**
```
I'm numbing again.

Could it be that I crave 
the very things 
that keep me small?

It's so nice to be held back
from the electric possibility 
of becoming all of me.
```

## Entry Point 3: "I can't stop lashing myself forward"
*Little whips and familiar poisons*

### Fragments:

**Full Poem - Little Lashes**
```
little lashes
are motivating myself by not liking myself
little lashes across the back
keep going
get up
find a reason

they hurt 
and i resent them
and i love their pain
because it
takes me
where i think i want to go

the young woman
in the cafe
slams shut her laptop
through a desperate smiling frustration 
looks to her friend says,
"why don't i let myself stop working?!"

the friend, framed in blonde waves
and giving a field of 
Tell me, my love
responds,
"you love its purpose."
```

- "If you're running experiments to manage yourself, they stop working." (Week 2)

---

## Entry Point 4: "Joy feels like a heart attack"
*When expansion threatens identity*

- "When I'm excited about something, I experience anxiety because joy can feel 'unmooring' - it dissolves the contrasts by which I know myself." (Week 7)

**Full Poem - Two Possums (Joy Breaking Through)**
```
Two possums
havin' a disagreement 
under the deck. 

Sounded like they were
in the living room with me.
I opened the front door
and banged my knee on the doorframe
involuntary jump.

Shouted across the house 
to my wife, "Possum battle!"
She said, "I can't come see,
I'm bottomless!"

The night is warm and windy,
joy spills over the cup of my heart.
```

**The Body's Confusion**
- "Fear of excitement means I'm already excited. Heart attack anxiety means my heart is already breaking open." (Week 7)
- "The feelings are so big, so expansive, the idea of self can't compete." (Week 7)

**Full Poem - Why Would It Be**
```
Why would it be 
that your Soul's desire 
is a righteous good?

Has anything
you've ever loved
been so simply beige?

The other side
shines with the joy 
of misery welcomed 
earnestly home.

So, kiss the brow 
of your small one,
loving their dark creativity.

Your Soul invites friendship
with even that part of you.
```

- "Woke with a smattering of somatic discomfort. Feeling ill. Spent time surfing the emotions. A lot of constriction." (Week 4)

**Full Poem - The Body Groans**
```
The body groans. 
Relax relax relax. 
What if it were easy, 
what if the abundance of love and connection 
was just how it is? 
What if you didn't have to work to earn it? 
What if you got to be a part of a team?
```

Patience is the slow unraveling
of an urgent tangle,
careful hands 
enjoying knots
unrushed.
Invited to speak
the natural pace
of our voice,
nowhere else to be
in the living room
of Soul.
```

---

**Full Poem - Something is Shifting**
```
Something is shifting 
The gates are moving
The keepers are rejiggering their positions

I am afraid of combining project based learning, the garden, and the portfolio 

The patterns of play are open source
Who has the sense of what's coming?
How can I not know?
How can I be in the service of the sense?
This creates a wiggle within. A turning of my stomach 
A part of me wishes to hands-on create
To discover new pattern 
To be the name on the building
Another deeper sense wishes to serve 
An emerging energy 
A communal possibility 
A relational, collaborative way of supporting through the projects which define us
Open up 
Speak to those who hear the call
It's here, waiting to meet you
It lives in relationship 

A vision of reaching out
A vision of interviewing 
A vision of being a man in conversation 
Using the garden to report on what I'm finding 
To aide in the communication of essay 

A part of me wishes to throw out this notion
This friction. This sense of a right way to do it
This idea of what an essay is
Of how communication should work 
Of what is trying to be accomplished
The fear of setting out with a goal 
Of not living up
```
