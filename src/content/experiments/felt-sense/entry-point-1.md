# There's a sharp pain when I think about sharing

_The body knows what the mind denies_

[← Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## Opening - The Physical Reality

"The disconnect I feel when considering sharing stories with the internet is a sharp and whipping pain. A puckering aversion." (Week 6)

"Hot metal slashes across my stomach. Proximity to a friend lying to themselves." (Week 1 Poem)

## The Cut

```
Hot metal slashes
across my stomach.
Proximity to a friend
lying to themselves.

Cut

I want it to be
any other way.

Cut

Invited to hard conversation.
To feel the disappointment.
To feel the small one abandoned.
To realize I asked for this.

Then

A welcome.
Join me in the garden,
let's feel this together.
It's a delight to embrace you.

—
There is a charge
```

## The Body's Memory

"Keep feeling the shame and resistance to publishing. There is a deep bind related to being seen. Needing loving witness, fearing being judged." (Week 5 & 6)

"Trust the mess. Your fear of being judged for messiness is just the echo of that church basement where questions meant rejection." (Week 8)

### Church Bells

```
My head is filled with church bells
Signaling a joyous day.
The ringing sings out across
My inner landscape
And reverberates in pockets of my remembering flesh.
I do and have done such disservice.
I am a walking vibration of abuses.
They line up at my door seeking their due,
Saying, Joy sent me here.
```

## Somatic Release

"Muscles groaning with released emotion. A shame unfeelable finally felt. Levied tensions find their untangled rest." (Week 4 Poem)

"ACT OUT YOUR CRITICAL VOICES TO FIND THEIR SOMATIC PATTERN." (Week 5)

## Revelation - The Medicine in the Wound

"Shame is the outline of my identity. What I'm most reluctant to share is proportional to its healing potential." (Week 8)

"Your body knows before your mind does. This physical aversion to being seen isn't intellectual - it's ancient wisdom that can be met with curiosity rather than force." (Week 7)
