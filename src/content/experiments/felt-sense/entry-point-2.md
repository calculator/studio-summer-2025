# I build elaborate systems to avoid simple feelings

_The architecture of avoidance_

[← Back to Felt-Sense Overview](/experiments/felt-sense)

## The Pattern Recognition

"My mechanized constraints have stood in for the tender touch of organic love. They've offered a type of hug—a pressure that feels safe but carries a coldness." (Week 1)

"Another framework, another elaborate architecture to keep the mess at bay. I see now how I've been building display cases for butterflies that need to fly." (Week 1)

## Symbols and Seeking

```
Symbols latch my eye
with hyper color hooks.
Brands sing siren songs
of promised meaning.

I'm pushing myself again
to rest the restless beam
of my attention
on the unique desire of my Soul.

Believing the I who is pushing
can fulfill this desire
without first having listened.
```

## The Decorator's Wisdom

"The decorator is a part who likes to beautify. Inviting him in too early is a cause of frustration." (Week 2)

"My pattern is to over design without inviting people in. To avoid reliance. Reliance is freedom." (Week 6, 7, 8)

## What Lives Beneath

"Your obsession with containers keeps you from experiencing what they're meant to contain. The map isn't the territory, and your organizational systems aren't the creative life they're meant to serve." (Week 1 Clearing)

### The Numbing

```
I'm numbing again.

Could it be that I crave
the very things
that keep me small?

It's so nice to be held back
from the electric possibility
of becoming all of me.
```

## Revelation - The Dance

"Structure and emergence must dance together." (Week 8)

"The garden isn't just metaphor; it's methodology. When you feel stuck, return to tending rather than producing." (Week 8)

"This garden isn't primarily about producing artifacts but about cultivating an ecosystem where inner dialogue becomes transformative." (Week 1)
