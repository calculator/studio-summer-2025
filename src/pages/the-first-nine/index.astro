From the porch
The bees were in the purple trees
in the front yard last week.
Pollinating away.
This week
The bees seem to have moved on
and the trees are exploding with green.<br>
The breeze wafts over me
and I am warm and cool
and carrying a sadness.
Something going away.
Some saying goodbye.
A loss.
        </p>
        
        <p>
The Garden a living shrine
in devotional friendship with the Ally
who teaches through images, through body, through the wisdom
that comes before words.<br><br>
As within, so without.
My inner landscape draws my outer reality.
How I meet my parts is how I meet the world.<br><br>
Fear as doorway.
Finding my fears is like finding exits from stuck patterns.
Each terror is a teacher disguised.<br><br>
Love creatives. The messy, the brilliant, the sad and mopey, the can't-get-started, the too-much-needing-to-be-seen.<br>
All of us.
        </p>
        
        <Image src={ohhand} alt="oh hand" class="modal-hand-image" />
        
        <p>
Final knowing:<br>
My greatest strength is the ability to feel discomfort all the way through. When I honor what I care about—especially what feels small or insignificant—I discover the path where freedom and form finally meet.

              content: `<p>Hot metal slashes across my stomach when I consider being seen. The internet feels like a church basement where questions meant rejection, where David with his glasses tallied our scripture failures, where shame became the only prayer I knew.</p>

<div class="poem">My head is filled with church bells
Signaling a joyous day. 
The ringing sings out across
My inner landscape
And reverberates in pockets of my remembering flesh. 
I do and have done such disservice. 
I am a walking vibration of abuses. 
They line up at my door seeking their due,
Saying, Joy sent me here.</div>

<p>The body remembers: throat clenched, jaw locked, neck turning away. Each muscle holds a story of the times I couldn't ask, couldn't speak, couldn't risk being cast out. Now when I think of sharing, my flesh puckers like fruit left too long in the sun.</p>

<p>But here's the medicine: What I'm most reluctant to share carries healing proportional to my resistance. The body knows before the mind admits. These sensations aren't warnings—they're invitations wearing fear's familiar costume.</p>`

              content: `<p>I've become an architect of beautiful prisons, each framework more elegant than the last. My constraints offer a type of hug—pressure that feels safe but carries winter's touch. I search for the perfect structure like a moth seeking the moon, believing if I could only find it, then relief.</p>

<div class="poem">Symbols latch my eye
with hyper color hooks.
Brands sing siren songs
of promised meaning.

I'm pushing myself again
to rest the restless beam
of my attention
on the unique desire of my Soul.</div>

The decorator arrives too early, wanting to beautify the mess before it's had time to mean anything. He polishes surfaces while depths remain untouched. Trust the desire paths, trust the creative mess, trust that the garden grows in darkness too.

<div class="poem">Could it be that I crave 
the very things 
that keep me small?

It's so nice to be held back
from the electric possibility 
of becoming all of me.</div>

<p>The truth: This garden isn't about artifacts but about cultivating soil where inner dialogue transforms. Structure and emergence must dance, not battle. The map was never the territory.</p>`

<p>The critic speaks with sugar-coated venom, sweet in intention but corrosive in method. There's nothing it says that's fully true—just partial truths weaponized against wholeness. You wouldn't keep a boss who managed like this voice manages you.</p>

<p>Tools become weapons when wielded for improvement. The moment I use them to "get better," they lose their magic. Love drains out, leaving only the hollow ring of should.</p>

<div class="poem">the young woman
slams shut her laptop
through desperate smiling frustration 
"why don't i let myself stop working?!"

her friend responds,
"you love its purpose."</div>

<p>Fear of excitement means I'm already excited. The heart attack I imagine is actually my heart breaking open.</p>

<div class="poem">Two possums
havin' a disagreement 
under the deck. 

Shouted across the house 
to my wife, "Possum battle!"
She said, "I can't come see,
I'm bottomless!"

The night is warm and windy,
joy spills over the cup of my heart.</div>

<p>We know ourselves by contrast. In joy, the boundaries dissolve. Who am I in this? What remains when the walls come down?</p>

<div class="poem">Has anything
you've ever loved
been so simply beige?

The other side
shines with the joy 
of misery welcomed 
earnestly home.

Your Soul invites friendship
with even that part of you.</div>

<p>The glimmers grow: colorful joy appearing when the try-hard relaxes, pleasure arriving unabashed. Without fear, there's enough. It floods in when I'm vulnerable with my excitement.</p>`

My body sends increasingly urgent messages: GERD burns when I swallowed my words, exhaustion weighs when I carry what isn't mine, the stomach churns with undigested experiences.</p>

<div class="poem">The body groans. 
Relax relax relax. 
What if it were easy?
What if you got to be a part of a team?</div>

<p>Disconnection tastes like late-night scrolling, like making projects to be seen rather than to see. Connection tastes like saying yes to relationship, like sharing experiments just to watch what grows.</p>

<p>The medicine is always movement. Thirteen miles on the bike to let anger dissipate through my legs. Or simpler: blanket on earth, letting the ground hold what I cannot. The young parts need space more than solutions.</p>

<p>My body knows before my mind admits. Each symptom is a teacher speaking in sensation's mother tongue.</p>`

              content: `<p>The glacier took decades to form: Dad absent, Mom overwhelmed. "I'll figure it out myself" became my frozen mantra. Each layer of ice a protection against the helplessness of needing.</p>

<p>Then the Lexus breaks down in Dripping Springs. $435 for a tow. The whole elaborate system—buying reliable trucks, maintaining them obsessively, avoiding the need for help—collapses with an alternator's death.</p>

<p>The tow truck driver builds supercharged Harleys. Has a network he calls without thinking. "People helping people," he says, like it's the most natural thing. His ease illuminates my disease.</p>

<p>There's a part that loves the crisis, gets high on the anguish, feels alive tasting how unsafe the world can be. At least in breakdown, the ice cracks.</p>

<p>The paradox: My pattern of over-designing without inviting people in was meant to ensure independence. But reliance is freedom. Helplessness—that close cousin of surrender—is the most potent change agent for self-reliance.</p>

<p>We're healed in relationship. The glacier melts drop by drop, each request for help a small spring arriving.</p>`

<p>This loneliness—I've made it special, a designer pain no one else could possibly own. But giving up the special means joining humanity. The knot in my gut loosens when I whisper: "Just like everyone else, I feel this."</p>

<p>I've touched the bottom of aloneness and found, surprisingly, joy stirring in the depths. The belief that I'm a mistake plays across reality only because I insist on the performance.</p>

<div class="poem">Patience is the slow unraveling
of an urgent tangle,
careful hands 
enjoying knots
unrushed.
Invited to speak
the natural pace
of our voice,
nowhere else to be
in the living room
of Soul.</div>

<p>There's a home in artists' hearts—my siblings, my champions, my kin. The love of it is almost too much to feel. But here's the secret: I've been home all along. This garden is my practice of belonging to myself.</p>`

<p>There's strange satisfaction in staying insignificant. It protects me from engaging with what I'm here to channel.</p>

<div class="poem">Something is shifting 
The gates are moving
The keepers are rejiggering their positions

I am afraid of combining project based learning, the garden, and the portfolio 

Who has the sense of what's coming?
How can I not know?
How can I be in the service of the sense?

A part of me wishes to hands-on create
To be the name on the building
Another deeper sense wishes to serve 
An emerging energy 
Open up 
Speak to those who hear the call
It lives in relationship</div>

<p>The skipping-ahead pattern: Learn to coach before coaching, lead before being led. Always jumping stages to avoid the vulnerability of being a beginner.</p>

<p>But projects aren't containers for achievement—they're vessels for evolution. Have a light hand. Risk their loss. What matters will survive the harvest.</p>

<p>It takes as long as it takes.</p>`

<p>The symptoms of repression: extreme self-talk, isolation that can't be soothed, feeling uncontainable, taking up too much space. My body speaks what my voice won't.</p>

<p>Then Kristen offers: "I see your anger and don't judge you." </p>

<p>Something fundamental shifts. I rant in text, move like a maniac, scream into pillows. Not dramatic. Just necessary. Immediate clarity after.</p>

<div class="poem">The ocean as loving awareness. 
Everything made of the same stuff. 
Infinite abundance. 
Don't need to hold onto any particular aspect of any of it, 
there's so much.</div>

<p>Emotions are weather systems, not binding contracts. On anger's backside: clarity. Behind helplessness: empowerment. After sadness: relief.</p>

<p>The truth that changes everything: If you're scared of feeling an emotion, you're already in it.</p>`
